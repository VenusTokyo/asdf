Introduction to Bitcoin and Blockchain
Before delving into cryptocurrency and its various implementations, we need to to comprehend its underlying technology — the blockchain. 

Simply put, a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks which are each cryptographically signed. Generally, each block consists of the cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and some data. By design, blockchain is decentralized, i.e., the blocks are not stored at any single point but rather, distributed across a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Hence, blockchain is considered to be “secure by design” and has high fault tolerance due to the lack of any single point of failure. 

A cryptocurrency is an implementation of blockchain technology. It isa digital asset that has no central authority and its state is maintained through distributed consensus. A cryptocurrency system allows transactions to be performed, in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. This ownership can be proved exclusively cryptographically. Transactions using cryptocurrency require a public key and a private key. For each transaction, a block on the blockchain is signed using the public key for global identification, and the private key acts like a password.

The first ever cryptocurrency to come into existence is the Bitcoin (BTC), in 2009. It was invented by an anonymous individual(s) who goes by the name of Satoshi Nakomoto. Bitcoins can be generated by mining. This involves producing a “Proof of Work” (PoW), which usually means processing time by a computer. PoW rose as a solution to the “double-spending” problem, and the longer blockchain is deemed as the correct  one.Bitcoin transactions have no intermediate actor, unlike real world money transactions mediated by banks. A transaction in bitcoin has no fees and no identity attached to it, and can be verified by miners. Bitcoin software is fully open source. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency, but rather an entire ecosystem for building decentralized apps. The cryptocurrency that exists in the Ethereum platform is Ether (ETH). The key difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is the existence of “Smart Contracts”. A smart contract is a protocol which facilitates the enforement or execution of a contract. It is written in a programming language called Solidity, and executed on the blockchain on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). A contract can be anything, for example: transfer of property to one’s name, in exchange of money. The smart contract can be programmed to transfer the property to the new name once the money has be recieved by the seller. This transaction is permanently written to the blockchain. 

Cryptocurrency exchanges are business that allow customers to trade digital currency for real money, or other digital currencies. These exchanges are decentralized and do not store the users’ funds. A common method used by people to earn money on these exchanges is to buy at an exchange where the currency is cheap, and sell at another for a higher price. Although, this method as become obsolete now with the maturity of the economy. Wallets allow managing multiple accounts across multiple currencies, from one single place. They are a safe way to store public/private keys and keep track of transactions. Wallets make interacting with cryptocurency seamless and approachable, even for someone lacking technical knowledge.

The Dark Web is a portion of the Internet that is inaccessible via a standard search engine like Google. It requries the use of special software like the Tor Browser. The Dark Web is a haven for illegal activity, because of the layers of encryption that hides them. These illegal purchases are always done using cryptocurrency like Bitcoin due to its inherent anonymity. This makes tracking purchases of illegal goods so much harder for law enforcement agencies.

ICOs or an Initial Coin Offering is used by companies as an alternative to being publicly traded. A company looking to generate funds creates its own digital currency with a value decided by them. These new coins are listed on an exchange. The holder of these coins get some perks and incentives. 

Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) is a “hard fork” of the original Bitcoin made by developers wanting to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit. 

Bitcoin mining is done using high-end, highly performant GPUs designed purely for the purpose of mining. These equipment are usually very expensive, and the electricity consumed by them alone is not enough to offset the amount of bitcoin mined. Hence, mining for bitcoin today is not viable and the best option is to purchase it from an exchange.
