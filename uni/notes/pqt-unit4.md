# characteristics of queue scheduling
- arrival of customers
- service pattern of servers
- queue discipline
- system capacity
- no of service channels
- no of service stages

## arrival of customers
1. bulk/batch
2. balked: arrives at q but decides not to enter
3. reneged: leaves queue after waiting
4. jockey: jumps around in paralell waiting lines

## service pattern of services
if system is empty, server is idle. service can be deterministic or probabilstic. servers can be dependent on the number of customers, also called state dependent service.

## queue discipline
1. FIFO
2. LIFO
3. Random Selection for Services (RSS)
4. Priority: a. preemptive b. non-preemptive

## system capacity
1. finite: q with limited waiting room
2. infinite: q with unlimited waiting room

## number of service channels
1. single channel system
2. multiple channel system

## number of service stages
1. single stage
2. multiple stage
