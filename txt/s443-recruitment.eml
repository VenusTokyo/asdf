Hi,

Thank you for applying to Sector443. This is a quick breifing of our
recruitment process.

The CTF will go live at 12:00 AM tonight (2400 hrs), and will be online
for 2 days (3rd - 4th Aug). Create an account at
https://ctf.sector443.xyz to start competing.

The interview round will be held on the 4th of August, Sunday.
This round does not depend on your performance in the CTF,
and in fact, can be attended directly. We however, do not recommend that
and your reason for not attempting the CTF will be questioned. Please
bring a copy of your résumé. A PDF should suffice.

To summarize:
	- CTF (https://ctf.sector443.xyz), 3rd - 4th Aug
	- Interview, 4th Aug, bring your résumé

Feel free to reach us out via email[1], Instagram[2], or Telegram [3].
