-----

- com.oklok.y/app/app.class contains the api url and (possibly) the key
- com.oklok.y/app/activity contains some interesting bt/password activities
    * some hardcoded checks?
- com.oklok.y/utils/b.class appears to have some kind of cryptography algo
- com.oklok.y/utils/k.class has some hardcoded pins?

- exploitation procedure:
    * having the mac address of a lock, the following info can be obtained:
        1. lock id
        2. barcode
        3. user name
    * with the barcode, the userid can be obtained
    * now, using the userid and lockid, the lock can be unbound from the owner
    * then, we can use our own userid, name and the lock's mac address to bind ourselves to the lock
    * we now have full control of the lock

- this info can be extracted from just knowing userid:
    * mac address
    * userid
    * lockid
    * barcode
    * username
    * email
    * lockkey
    * isAdmin is 0 (idk what that is)
