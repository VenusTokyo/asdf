IoT Security Internship — Anirudh Oppiliappan
=============================================

3rd June 2019 - 18th June 2019
------------------------------

- Started with the IoT Exploitation Handbook and video series.
- Explored firmware reverse engineering
    1. Reversed what we thought was the firmware for the iBall router
    2. Performed static analysis on the binaries in the filesystem
- Setup Raspberry Pi for practicing ARM RE and exploitation
- Dived into ARM exploitation and reverse engineering
    1. Learnt ARM assembly
    2. Reversing basic programs
    3. Stack based exploitation and ROP (wrote a blog post on this)
    4. Heap exploitation
- Studied the IoT Security Maturity Model (SMM)
    * Made a presentation for the same
- Began learning MIPS
    1. Learnt MIPS assembly
    2. Same exploitation techniques
- Attempted to reverse engineer HCI Bluetooth packet log between my smartphone and smartwatch
    1. Acheived extraction of some forensic data
- Began writing MIPS/ARM based exploitation challenges to be hosted on SL7's GitHub

18th June 2019
-------------

- Wrote a post for the SL7 blog, titled "ARM Exploitation Series #1 — Introduction to the ARM Architecture"
- Explored the new Intel Galileo Gen 2 board
- Continued with my MIPS exploitation research
