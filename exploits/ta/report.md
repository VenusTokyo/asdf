# Profanity check bypass in photo upload

The description box in the “Post photos” activity checks for profanity and doesn’t let you post if your description contains any offensive words. This can be bypassed by intercepting the request where the check happens, changing the parameter to contain no profane language, and then proceed. The actual request containing the profane text remains intact and is sent to the server.

In the HTTP request below, in the `texts` parameter the word `fucks` was replaced with `heavens`, and then submitted.
